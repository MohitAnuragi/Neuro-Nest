⚠️⚠️⚠️ OBSOLETE FILE - COMPLETELY DISABLED ⚠️⚠️⚠️

This file contained the OLD 50-level hardcoded implementation.

The NEW correct implementation is in: LevelGridScreen.kt
- Supports 500 levels
- Uses Flow-based reactive updates
- Properly unlocks levels after completion

This file has been renamed to .txt to prevent compilation.
DO NOT RENAME BACK TO .kt OR USE THIS FILE!

If you need the old code for reference, check git history.

The old version had:
- Only 50 levels hardcoded
- LevelManager (old system)
- No reactive updates
- Manual progress tracking

All functionality has been replaced with the new system in LevelGridScreen.kt
